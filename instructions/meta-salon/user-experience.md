### User experience (UX) 

Technology stack recommendations for the cross-platform voting game for the arts.
User Experience (UX) Design:

1. Voting Flow:
	- Design a smooth and intuitive voting experience that feels like a video game.
	- Present users with a pair of artworks and allow them to select their favorite using a gesture-based interaction (e.g., swipe left/right, tap).
	- Incorporate physics-based animations and visual effects to create a sense of fluidity and responsiveness.
	- Provide visual cues and feedback to the user during the voting process, such as artwork scaling, rotation, or particle effects.
	- Optimize the voting flow for both touch-based (mobile/tablet) and pointer-based (desktop) interactions.
2. Voting Themes:
	- Develop multiple distinct voting themes, each with its own unique visual style and physics-based animations.
	- Ensure a cohesive and consistent user experience across all themes, while allowing for unique animations and interactions.
	- Allow users to select their preferred theme or rotate through them automatically.
3. Leaderboards and Feedback:
	- Implement real-time leaderboards that display the top-voted artworks, updating dynamically as new votes come in.
	- Provide users with immediate feedback on their votes, such as artwork placement changes or token balance updates.
	- Incorporate social features, like the ability to share votes or comment on artworks, to foster a sense of community.
	- Gamify the leaderboard experience with achievement tracking, badges, or other reward systems.
4. Artwork Gallery:
	- Design an intuitive interface for users to browse, discover, and interact with the digital artworks.
	- Allow users to view detailed information about each artwork, such as the artist, medium, and description.
	- Implement a seamless integration between the artwork management and the token-based voting system.
	- Provide tools for artists to manage and update their artwork portfolios within the digital vault.
Technology Stack Recommendations:
1. Front-end:
	- Framework: React enable cross-platform development and a consistent user experience across mobile, tablet, and web.
	- UI Library: Chakra UI, to provide a solid foundation for the user interface and comply with accessibility standards.
	- Animation Library: GSAP or Framer Motion to create the fluid, physics-based animations for the voting experience.
	- State Management: Redux or MobX, to manage the application's state, including the token system and voting data.
2. Back-end:
	- Server-side Runtime: Node.js with vite, to build the API endpoints and handle server-side logic.
	- Database: Postgres to store the artwork metadata, token balances, and voting history in a flexible, document-oriented database.
	- Real-time Communication: Socket.IO or WebSockets, to enable the real-time updates for the leaderboards and voting activity.
	- Blockchain Integration: Consider integrating a blockchain platform, such as Solana, Bitcoin SV, to provide a secure and transparent token system.
