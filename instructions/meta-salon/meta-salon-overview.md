### 1. Platform Architecture
#### 1.1 System Overview
Meta.Salon operates as a distributed platform combining several key components:
- Digital Value Containers (Artwork Vaults)
- Dynamic Pair Voting System
- Token Economy (SLN)
- Challenge Framework
- Social Curation Layer

#### 1.2 User Roles
The platform supports three primary user types, each with distinct capabilities:
#### Artists
- Content creation and submission
- Voting pack management
- Vault management
- Challenge participation
- Analytics access
- Portfolio management

#### Curators
- Voting pack management
- Challenge creation
- Curation activities
- Performance analytics

#### Moderators
- Content quality control
- Challenge management
- Platform health monitoring
- Report handling

### 2. Core Mechanisms
#### 2.1 Digital Value Containers
Each artwork functions as a secure digital vault with the following properties:
- Value accumulation through votes
- Transparent transaction history
- Lock-up bonus mechanisms
- Real-time value tracking

### 2.2 Voting System
The platform implements a sophisticated voting mechanism:
#### Voting Packs
- Denominations: 1-cent, 2-cent, 5-cent, 10-cent
- Transferability before activation
- Gift functionality
- Usage tracking
#### Dynamic Pair Voting
- Real-time artwork comparison
- Physics-based animations
- Intelligent pair matching
- Value distribution algorithm

### 2.3 Token Economy
Salon Tokens â†’SLN (adjustable) serve as the platform's internal currency:
#### Token Properties
- Minimum unit: 1 SLN
- Primary use: Voting power, Value allocation
- Secondary use: Artwork purchase
- Storage: Digital vaults
- Lock (locking spendability for days,weeks,months,years)
#### Value Mechanisms
- Direct voting rewards
- Challenge pool distributions
- Locked value bonuses
- Transparent ledger

### Key Features
1. Token System: The application uses a custom token system, called "Salon Tokens", to power the voting functionality and enable other features like artwork purchases and value attribution.
2. Voting Packs: Users can purchase different types of voting packs, each with varying numbers of votes and token weightings, to influence the voting process.
3. Artwork Gallery: Users can browse, discover, and view details of the available artworks, which are stored in a secure digital asset vault.
4. Leaderboard: A real-time leaderboard displays the top-voted artworks and their token balances, updating dynamically as new votes are cast.
5. Artwork Marketplace: Users can purchase artwork vaults using their token balances, facilitating the trading and ownership of digital art.
6. Artist Portfolio Management: Artists can manage their artwork portfolios, including adding, updating, and viewing the token balances and transaction histories for their artwork vaults.




Requirements for a cross-platform voting game for the arts, 
1. Architecture Design:
	- Choosen Technology stack: NodeJS, React, Supabase, Vite
	- Determine the backend architecture, which could include a Node.js server, a database for storing artwork and token data, and a real-time communication layer (e.g., WebSockets) for the leaderboards.
2. Token System:
	- Design a token model that represents the voting currency, including properties like token balance, transaction history, and ownership.
	- Implement a token minting and distribution system, potentially tied to user accounts or artwork ownership.
	- Ensure the token system is secure, transparent, and auditable.
3. Voting System:
	- Create a voting model that allows users to select their favorite artwork from a pair, recording the vote and updating the corresponding artwork's token balance.
	- Implement a real-time leaderboard that displays the top-voted artworks, updating dynamically as new votes come in.
	- Consider gamifying the voting experience by introducing voting themes, physics-based animations, and a fluid, video game-like user interface.
4. Digital Asset Vault:
	- Develop a system to store and manage the digital artworks, treating each artwork as a unique "account" that can accumulate tokens.
	- Integrate the token system with the artwork accounts, allowing tokens to be used for voting and potentially other features (e.g., artwork purchases, artist commissions).
	- Means to buy tokens and cash out token from artwork accounts and add it to the balance
	- Ensure the digital vault provides secure storage, versioning, and ownership tracking for the artworks.
5. User Experience:
	- Design a highly engaging and intuitive user interface for the voting flow, with smooth transitions, animations, and interactions that keep users engaged.
	- Implement features that foster a sense of community and competition, such as leaderboards, achievement tracking, and social sharing.
	- Ensure the user experience is consistent and coherent across different platforms (web, mobile, tablet) and voting themes.
6. Testing and Deployment:
	- Set up a comprehensive testing suite to validate the functionality, performance, and user experience of the application.
	- Implement a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to streamline the development and release process.
	- Ensure the application is optimized for different devices and screen sizes, with a focus on accessibility and responsiveness.
7. Security and Scalability:
	- Implement robust security measures to protect the token system, digital vault, and user data, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.
	- Design the backend architecture to be scalable and resilient, able to handle increasing numbers of users and voting activity without performance degradation.
	- Monitor the application's usage and performance, and be prepared to scale resources as needed.
